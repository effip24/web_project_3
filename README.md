**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

* Fonts in some breakpoints were calculated using a formula to make them responsive:
  * Formula: font-size: calc([minimum size] + ([maximum size] - [minimum size]) * ((100vw - [minimum viewport width]) / ([maximum viewport width] - [minimum viewport width]))); (click [here] for more details(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/))
